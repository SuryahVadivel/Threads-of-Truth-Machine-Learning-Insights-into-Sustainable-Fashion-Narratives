Threads of Truth explores how Vogue India reflects the evolving tension between commercial fashion trends and sustainability.  
Using Machine Learning, the project applies:
- Topic Modeling (LDA) to uncover evolving editorial themes  
- Sentiment Analysis to track emotional tone over time  
- Google Trends correlation to measure real-world cultural resonance
